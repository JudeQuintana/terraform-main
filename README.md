### Notes
- Sometimes I'll blog about ideas at [jq1.io](https://jq1.io).
- All modules are first developed in the [terraform-modules](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-modules) repo.
- The most useful modules are [published](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/JudeQuintana) to the Public Terraform Registry.
- All demos include an example of generating security group rules for inter-region and cross-region VPCs for each TGW configuration.
  - [Intra VPC Security Group Rule](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-aws-intra-vpc-security-group-rule) (IPv4 only)
  - [Super Intra VPC Security Group Rules](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-aws-super-intra-vpc-security-group-rules) (IPv4 only)
  - [Full Mesh Intra VPC Security Group Rules](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-aws-full-mesh-intra-vpc-security-group-rules) (IPv4 only)
  - [IPv6 Intra VPC Security Group Rule](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-aws-ipv6-intra-vpc-security-group-rule) (IPv6 only, for use with dual stack VPCs)
  - New [IPv6 Full Mesh Intra VPC Security Group Rules](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-aws-ipv6-full-mesh-intra-vpc-security-group-rules) (IPv6 only, for use with dual stack VPCs)
  - TODO: Mega Mesh Intra VPC Security Group Rules
- The Centralized Router module is an implementation of the [AWS Centralized Router concept](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-centralized-router.html) but without VPN Gateway or Direct Connect, only VPCs.
 - Available AZs (a,b,c etc) in a region are different per AWS account (ie. your us-west-2a is not the same AZ as my us-west-2a)
    so it's possible you'll need to change the AZ letter for a VPC if the provider is saying it's not available for the region.
- There is no overlapping CIDR detection inter-region or cross-region so it's important that the VPC's network and subnet CIDRs are allocated correctly.
