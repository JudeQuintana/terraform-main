# Mega Mesh
Mega Mesh == (Full Mesh Trio)Â² + 1

[Mega Mesh module](https://github.com/JudeQuintana/terraform-aws-mega-mesh) takes in 10 Centralized Routers and composes a Full Mesh Transit Gateway topology across 10 regions from existing hub spokes in AWS. It peers and generates routes for TGWs and their respective VPCs.

 - Sometimes I get questions regarding the difference between full mesh TGWs
   and CloudWAN. I'm reposting my reply here:

 > I haven't had the chance work with CloudWAN yet. I've talked to a few people about the differences.
 >
 > There can only be one routing domain with full mesh TGW topology because you can only have one peering link between a pair of TGWs so you can't really segment traffic across regions even when you're separating route tables across TGWs.
 >
 > CloudWAN allows for multiple routing domains spanning regions via segments. You can choose to share routes between them and it hides the peering, route table, etc management. The high cost tradeoff is it makes managing large networks with traffic segmentation easier vs engineers managing a large TGW topology themselves.
 >
 > That's what I've gathered so far but maybe more knowledgeable people can chime in. Hopefully I'll be able to tinker with CloudWAN in the near future.

1. It begins
  - `terraform init`

2. Build VPCs (must exist before centralized routers and mega mesh) and S3 Gateways:
  - `terraform apply -target module.vpcs_use1 -target module.vpcs_usw1 -target module.vpcs_euc1 -target module.vpcs_euw1 -target module.vpcs_apne1 -target module.vpcs_apse1 -target module.vpcs_cac1 -target module.vpcs_sae1 -target module.vpcs_use2 -target module.vpcs_usw2 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_use1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_usw1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_euc1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_euw1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_apne1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_apse1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_cac1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_sae1 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_use2 -target aws_vpc_endpoint.s3_usw2`

3. Build Centralized Routers
  - `terraform apply -target module.centralized_router_use1 -target module.centralized_router_usw1 -target module.centralized_router_euc1 -target module.centralized_router_euw1 -target module.centralized_router_apne1 -target module.centralized_router_apse1 -target module.centralized_router_sae1 -target module.centralized_router_use2 -target module.centralized_router_usw2`

4. Build Mega Mesh
  - `terraform apply -target module.mega_mesh`

Mesh Complete!

Notes:
  - You can combine steps 3 and 4 with `terraform apply`.
  - Add blackhole cidrs on any centralized router via the
    `var.centralized_router.blackhole_cidrs` list to create blackhole routes or aggregate routes.
  - Available AZs (a,b,c etc) in a region are different per AWS account (ie. your us-west-2a is not the same AZ as my us-west-2a) so it's possible you'll need to change the AZ letter for a VPC if the provider is saying it's not available for the region.

Routing and peering validation with AWS Route Analyzer:
- Go to [AWS Network Manager](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home?region=us-east-1#/networks) (free to use)
  - Create global network -> `next`
    - UNCHECK `Add core network in your global network` or you will be billed extra -> `next`
  - Select new global network -> go to `Transit Gateways` -> `Register
    Transit Gateway` -> Select TGWs -> `Register Transit Gateway` -> wait until all states say `Available`

  - Go to `Transit gateway network` -> `Route Analyzer`
    - Cross-Region Test 1
      - Source:
        - Transit Gateway: Choose `TEST-centralized-router-mystique-use1`
        - Transit Gateway Attachment: Choose `TEST-tiered-vpc-app1-use1 <-> TEST-centralized-router-mystique-use1` (VPC)
        - IP Address: `10.0.11.4`
      - Destination:
        - Transit Gateway: Choose `TEST-centralized-router-gambit-apse1`
        - Transit Gateway Attachment: Choose `TEST-tiered-vpc-app6-apse1 <-> TEST-centralized-gambit-apse1` (VPC)
        - IP Address: `10.0.64.7`
      - Select `Run Route Analysis`
        - Forward and Return Paths should both have a `Connected` status.

    - Cross-Region Test 2
      - Source:
        - Transit Gateway: Choose `TEST-centralized-router-gambit-apse1`
        - Transit Gateway Attachment: Choose `TEST-tiered-vpc-app6-apse1 <-> TEST-centralized-router-gambit-apse1` (VPC)
        - IP Address: `10.0.70.8`
      - Destination:
        - Transit Gateway: Choose `TEST-centralized-router-rogue-euw1`
        - Transit Gateway Attachment: Choose `TEST-tiered-vpc-general4-euw1 <-> TEST-centralized-rogue-euw1` (VPC)
        - IP Address: `192.168.38.6`
      - Select `Run Route Analysis`
        - Forward and Return Paths should both have a `Connected` status.

    - Cross-Region Test 3
      - Source:
        - Transit Gateway: Choose `TEST-centralized-router-wolverine-sae1`
        - Transit Gateway Attachment: Choose `TEST-tiered-vpc-app8-apse1 <-> TEST-centralized-router-woverine-sae1` (VPC)
        - IP Address: `10.0.128.10`
      - Destination:
        - Transit Gateway: Choose `TEST-centralized-router-jean-grey-apne1`
        - Transit Gateway Attachment: Choose `TEST-tiered-vpc-app5-apne1 <-> TEST-centralized-jean-grey-apne1` (VPC)
        - IP Address: `172.16.40.9`
      - Select `Run Route Analysis`
        - Forward and Return Paths should both have a `Connected` status.

Several other routes can be validated, try them out!

Tear down:
 - `terraform destroy` (long pause)
